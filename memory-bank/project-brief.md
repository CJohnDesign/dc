- Updated fonts using Rethink Sans from Google fonts for body and Merriweather for headings
- Fixed the home page fonts to address white text visibility issues (Apply Now button, core-process-section, and client-journey-section)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Update routes for dashboard page in `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/layout.tsx`.
