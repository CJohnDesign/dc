# Project Rules for Deliver Capital Dashboard

## General Principles
- Maintain a clean, professional visual aesthetic appropriate for a financial service
- Prioritize responsive design with a mobile-first approach
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Ensure consistency in UI components and styling

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use interfaces over types for object definitions
- Maintain clean folder structure with logical component organization
- Follow the Next.js App Router conventions
- Minimize client-side JavaScript and use Server Components where possible

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Body text: Rethink Sans from Google Fonts
- Headings: Merriweather from Google Fonts
- Follow the color palette defined in tailwind.config.ts
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Use ShadCN components extended with custom styling when needed

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize images (WebP format, appropriate sizing)
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Use React.Suspense for loading states
- Minimize third-party dependencies
- Ensure fast initial page load and time-to-interactive

## Development Workflow
- Use pnpm as the package manager
- Use the Next.js development server: `pnpm dev`
- Reference mockups in memory-bank/mockups directory
- Follow component naming conventions: PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files
- Organize components in logical folders that reflect their purpose

## Deployment
- Ensure all environment variables are properly configured
- Run build tests locally before deployment
- Check for console errors and warnings
- Verify responsive design on multiple viewports
